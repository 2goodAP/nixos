# How the image is parse, in order to get the colors:
#  * full       - Reads the whole image (more precision, slower).
#  * resized    - Resizes the image to 1/4th of the original, before parsing it (more color mixing, faster).
#  * thumb      - Fast algo hardcoded to 512x512 (faster than resized).
#  * wal        - Uses image magick `convert` to read the image (less colors).
#  * fastresize - Much faster algo that uses SIMD. For some reason it fails on some images
#                  where `resized` doesn't, for this reason is not replaced, but a new method.
backend = "fastresize"

# What color space to use to produce and select the most prominent colors:
#  * lab      - Use CIEL*a*b color space
#  * labmixed - Variant of lab that mixes colors, if not enough colors it fallbacks
#                to usual lab, for that reason is not recommended in small images
#  * labfast  - Variant of lab which ignores decimals, leading to a faster but not
#                that much precise result. Images that work on lab/labmixed could
#                not have "enough colors" for labfast.

# Difference between similar colors, used by the colorspace:
#  1          Not perceptible by human eyes.
#  1 - 2      Perceptible through close observation.
#  2 - 10     Perceptible at a glance.
#  11 - 49    Colors are more similar than opposite
#  100        Colors are exact opposite
threshold = 20

# Use the most prominent colors in a way that makes sense, a scheme:
#  * dark      - 8 dark colors, color0 darkest - color7 lightest, dark background light contrast
#  * dark16    - same as dark but it displays 16 colors
#  * harddark  - same as dark but with darker hard hue colors
#  * light     - 8 light colors, color0 lightest - color7 darkest, light background dark contrast
#  * light16   - same as light but displays 16 colors
#  * softlight - counterpart of `harddark`
